# glTF-Browser-Extension

Adds a preview button for glTF 2.0 models on GitHub.

## Permissions

> *Read and change your data on github.com.*

Required to access glTF content on the page you're viewing.

> *Read your browsing history.*

GitHub uses the History API when changing pages, and this extension can't tell when you open a new page on the GitHub website without access to browsing history.
