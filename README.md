# glTF-Browser-Extension

Adds a preview button for glTF 2.0 models on GitHub.

Permissions:

- "Read and change your data on github.com." Needed to access the glTF file on a page you're viewing.
- "Read your browsing history." GitHub uses the History API when changing pages, and this extension can't tell when you open a new page (to detect if it's a glTF file) without access to browsing history.
